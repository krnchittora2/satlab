						<p>GLEE (The Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone) is a mission to the surface of the Moon, to conduct scientific experiments and test technology using hundreds of LunaSats (ChipSats of size 5cm x 5cm). These LunaSats are being built by students from all around the world. Yes, these are devices that can literally fit in the palm of your hand, capable of carrying out complex payloads on the surface of the moon. The project is headed by a team from CU Boulder with various other universities all over the world part of it. Our team at IITBSSP is one of the many student teams actively involved in the mission. The work that we do includes study for possible payloads, component interfacing for the LunaSat and designing the PCB for the same. </p>
