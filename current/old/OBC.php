<h3>The On-Board Computer Sub-system</h3>


  <p align="justify"><img src="images/OBC.jpg" alt="Data and Command Handling Subsystem" width="328" height="262" class="float_right" />The On-Board Computer Sub-system    is like the brain of the satellite. It controls the way the satellite functions and is expected to take all the decisions for the satellite. </p>
  <p align="justify">The on-board computer (an ARM microcontroller) regulates the flow of data,executes the attitude-control loop and other such computational /decision tasks and also decides which sub-systems are to be kept on/off/idle in emergency situations. Since a failure of the OBC results in a failure of the satellite, a lot of emphasis is placed on robustness and the resistance of the OBC to errors (hardware/software)  that may occur.
    Space-grade components are preferred to ensure a long life for the satellite.</p>
  <p> The On-Board Computer team performs the following jobs :-<br />
    1. Collects data from the attitude sensors (magnetometers) and executes control loops (PID,H2 etc) and gives a feedback to the actuators (magnetorquers).<br />
    2. Collects house-keeping data like operational status of subsystems, power consumed, battery power left etc and based on this takes appropriate decisions.In case of emergency, this decision is sent to the <a href="PS.html">Power Subsystem</a> to take corrective action.<br />
    3. Initiates the transmission of data to the ground station at an appropriate time (i.e. when the satellite is visible from the ground station).<br />
    4. Collects data from other miscellaneous peripherals like the GPS, magnetometer.<br />
