<h3>System Engineering</h3>
  <p>The System Engineer has the job of seeing the mission of the project as a whole and dividing it into requirements which for each of the Sub-System. One of the interesting paradoxes that the System Engineer often encounters during his work is the level of detail he is supposed to know and grasp about each Sub-System. A System Engineer cannot become a walking encyclopedia for the project who accurately keeps track of all the little details in each Sub-System. But at the same time, the best design solution will emerge only when these details are taken care of.</p>
