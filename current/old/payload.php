<h3>Payload Subsystem</h3>


  <p align="justify"><img src="images/payload.jpg" alt="IITBombay" width="336" height="262" class="float_right" />Payload team: The payload represents the goal of the satellite. It stands for the  purpose the satellite is going to serve, once it is in orbit. <br />
    <br />
    With our first satellite 'Pratham', we wish to measure the  ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) by the 'Faraday Beacon'  method. Analysis of the total electron content gives us an insight into  various characteristics of the ionosphere. <br />
    <br />
    In order to measure the Total Electron Content, the satellite will  have two parallel monopole antennae transmitting linearly polarized  radio waves at frequencies of 400 and 433 MHz. The plane of  polarization of these signals will rotate upon traveling through the  ionosphere. By measuring the differential rotation of the plane of  polarisation of these two signals, using crossed Yagi antennae, we can  deduce the value of the Total Electron Content along the column through  which the signals have passed. Analysis of the data from various ground  stations (Ionosphere Tomography) will enable us to determine the  distribution of electrons in different layers of the ionosphere. <br />
    <br />
    TEC values are crucial for time delay and range error corrections for  single frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Latitudinal  variation of TEC values over India will allow us to analyse the  Equatorial Ionisation Anomaly (EIA) which has a bearing on the range of  satellite based communication systems. The influence of solar activity  on TEC values can also be studied.<br />
    <br />
    We  will require ground stations to be set up in various universities  across India to capture the latitudinal variation in the values of TEC.  This forms the social goal of our satellite. We wish to reach out to  the students in various universities across India and invite them to  become an integral part of our endeavour. This will give them an  opportunity to learn the basics of satellite communication systems and  satellite technology in general. <br />
