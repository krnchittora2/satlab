<h3>'Ground Station' Workshop</h3>


  <div>
    <p align="justify">Team <em>Pratham </em>feels  that the entire country should benefit by the knowledge and experience  that the team has gained while going through the satellite building process.  We propose to share our knowledge by organizing workshops which will  inspire others in the field of satellite technology.</p>
    <p align="justify"><b>Tushar Jadhav</b> is heading this initiative. Please contact him at email:tusharj.iitb@gmail.com, mobile: +91-9403869125</p>
    <p align="justify">A Google Group named <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/social-goal-iitb-satellite-pratham?hl=en">"Social Goal IITB Satellite Pratham"</a> has been launched to facilitate sharing of information among the participating universities. Please join it. </p>
    <p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p align="justify">Since the third Groundstation Workshop held in June 2010, we have   received a large number of requests from students from different   universities who wish to be a part of the IIT Bombay's Student Satellite   Project &quot;Pratham&quot;. Hence we invite   you to the fourth workshop of the series. The details are as follows:<br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Date: 15th May, 2011<br />
      Time: 9 AM to 5 PM<br />
      Venue: Aerospace Seminar Hall, Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Bombay<br />
      </span><br />
      We   are also inviting the previous participants of the workshops, including   the team from IPGP France, to show-case the work they have done in   their universities, so that their experience will be beneficial to   everyone. If possible, we shall also try to do end-to-end testing with   the Pratham Satellite's hardware. <a href="otherdocs/Schedule for 4th groundstation workshop.pdf">Click here for the schedule. </a></p>
    <p align="justify">Of course, like all previous workshops, there are no   registration fees, etc. for attending the workshop.<br />

    <p align="justify">The <strong>Second Ground Station workshop</strong> was  conducted on 22nd  August, 2009 at IITB. It dealt with simulation and design of Ground station crossed Yagi- Uda antennae using 4NEC2 software. There will be a brief overview of the satellite project by Ms. Haripriya folowed by an introduction to  crossed yagis by Mr. Jhonny Jha in the morning session . Mr. Saptarshi Bandyopadhyaya will be giving a brief talk on "failure modes" in the afternoon session followed by  simulation and optimization of crossed yagis which will be taken up by Ms. Deepika Thakur of the Communication and Ground station  subsystem. </p>

    <p align="justify">The <strong>First Ground Station workshop</strong>,  conducted on 12th October, 2008 at IITB, which was to enable students  to learn the technology of making a ground station. We hope that  through these workshops, student teams will be able to make a working  low cost ground station (&lt;20,000 Rs) capable of receiving signals  and data from our satellite. Around 8 universities participated in this  workshop.</p>
    <p align="justify">We have compiled Basic Information about the Ground Station so that you get an idea of the technology involved. Click <a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham/otherdocs/groundstation.pdf"><u>here</u></a> to download the file.</p>
