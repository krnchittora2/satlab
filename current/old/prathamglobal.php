When I was in college, I was building radios -- not satellites! I wish them all the best. I don't think they need &quot;luck&quot;. My two visits to India have left me more than a little impressed with Indian aerospace engineers. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic">I truly hope to visit again in some new capacity! </p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic">All the best.</p>

As a part of this initiative, Boeing has provided substantial funding for student projects. Pratham, being the frontrunner project, has received a large chunk of the funding provided to IIT Bombay. This funding has been used for procurement of components necessary for the satellite. We are thankful to Boeing for their support. </p>
