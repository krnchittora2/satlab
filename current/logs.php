Prof. Lognonné also delivered a talk titled "Observations and modeling of Tsunami and seismic waves signal in the Ionosphere with GPS, space altimeters and over-the-horizon radars". The interaction between French and Indian team was beneficial and helped foster stronger ties between both teams.</p>

The final solution proposed needs considerable change in the battery charging and protection circuit of the Power Sub-System. The need circuit needs to be designed and tested. The images below shows the detailed simulation used for this purpose and the coverage Earth where the transmission is switched on.</p>

The sensors, namely GPS, Magnetometer and 6 Sun-sensors and the actuators, namely 3 Magnetorquers, have been modeled to mimic reality, and their models have been validated. Although the OBC boards is not ready, hence not connected to it to receive the data. Congrats to Sanyam and Saptarshi!</p>
