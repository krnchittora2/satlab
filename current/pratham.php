						<p>'Pratham' was the first satellite under IIT Bombay Student Satellite Project. The plan was to build a fully functional microsatellite which would then be launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). This was entirely a student initiative with mentorship provided by ISRO scientists and IIT Bombay Faculty. The satellite was able to fit in a 30.5cm X 33.5cm X 46.6cm cube and weighed 10.15kg. excluding FE Ring. </p>

						<p>For the relevance of the satellite to the student community, the satellite data was transmitted when the satellite passed over India so that any interested university with a small ground station was not only able to detect the beacon signal from our satellite but was also able to measure TEC above their ground station. This was proposed to spread awareness among the student community about this exciting field. The Pratham Project presented a wonderful learning experience to the students of working on a real life multidisciplinary complex system.</p>

					<p class="ft-18">'Pratham' had a Four-fold Mission Statement:</p>
					<ul class="ft-18">
						<li>Enabling students and faculty to gain knowledge and experience in the field of Satellite and Space technology.</li>
						<li>Empowering the Satellite Team with the skills to develop the Satellite through various phases of Design, Analysis, Fabrication and Testing until the Flight Model is made.</li>
						<li>Launching the satellite into orbit and measuring Total Electron Count of the Ionosphere.</li>
						<li>Involving students from other universities in our Satellite mission by building ground stations in their universities.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="ft-18 mb-3p">The Pratham Project presented a wonderful learning experience to the students of working on a real life multidisciplinary complex system. Learning enhancement through CDIO (Conceiving – Designing – Implementing – Operating) was one of the major objectives of this project. Since a lot of importance was attached to learning, it was duly visible in the Success Criterion for the Mission.</p>
